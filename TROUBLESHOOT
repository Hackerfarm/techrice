* When an arashi board is responding with RADIO NOT INITIALIZED PROPERLY, check that the ethernet chip select is correctly set up:

pinMode(31, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(31, HIGH);


* When the saboten seems to not transmit unless you touch the ground plane, check your godamn libraries!

* When the saboten ethernet does not seem to initialize (DHCP fails, can't set up an IP address) it may be that you are using the default arduino ethernet libraries while in fact you should use this project's modified version
